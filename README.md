## Setup

Note this application is designed for a **server-to-server** scenario, so a bit of extra coding will be needed if you are using this application in other scenarios.

1. Ensure the required dependencies are installed.  See above require composer packages.
2. Update the file config.json and complete the values for `secret_path`, `client_path`, `subject` and `developerKey`. These are obtained from the Google Developers Console at : https://console.developers.google.com. The `secret_path` and `client_path` are the paths to JSON files on your server which are obtained from the Google Console.
